# Junk Sorter

A simple Java program that sorts an array of strings based on their length, from longest to shortest.

## How It Works

The `Junk` class contains methods to sort and display the array:
- **sort()**: Sorts the array based on length.
- **junks()**: Prints the sorted array.

## Example Usage

To use the Junk Sorter:

1. **Compile** the `MyClass.java` file.
2. **Run** the program to see the sorted output:
   - Input: `["e", "eh", "Hey", "weh"]`
   - Output: `[Hey, weh, eh, e]`
